## Summary
- **SWE/ML focus** with shipped analysis platform and tooling used by 20+ scientists.  
- **Throughput & reliability:** caching + parallelism → **3×** more concurrent comparisons.  
- **Research-aware engineer:** eval tooling, algorithm selection, audio ML, interpretability.

## Experience
**Amazon — Alexa AI (NLU), SDE Intern**  
- Built ML support tools and a central analysis platform used by 20+ scientists.  
- Increased analysis throughput (**3×** concurrent comparisons) via caching/parallelization.  
- Co-designed evaluation metrics/frameworks for LLM API-calling behavior at scale.

## Selected Projects
**Analysis Platform for ML Scientists** — experiment tracking, cached comparisons, batched data access.  
**Energy-Aware Algorithm Selection** — long-horizon perf/energy traces; lower-energy solver picks.  
**Dolphin Acoustics (Detection & Classification)** — signal-processing + ML/CV; F1 **0.48 → 0.86**.
