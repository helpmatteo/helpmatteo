## Experience
**Amazon — Alexa AI (NLU), SDE Intern**  
- Built ML support tools and a central analysis platform used by 20+ scientists.  
- Increased analysis throughput (**3×** concurrent comparisons) via caching/parallelization.  
- Co-designed evaluation metrics/frameworks for LLM API-calling behavior at scale.

## Selected Projects
**Analysis Platform for ML Scientists** — lightweight services for experiment tracking, cached comparisons, and batched data access.  
**Energy-Aware Algorithm Selection** — long-horizon perf/energy traces; features for models that pick lower-energy solvers.  
**Dolphin Acoustics (Detection & Classification)** — signal-processing + ML/CV; F1 **0.48 → 0.86** vs prior approach.
