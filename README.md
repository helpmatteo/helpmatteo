## Summary
- **SWE/ML focus** with shipped analysis platform and tooling used by 20+ scientists.  
- **Throughput & reliability:** caching + parallelism to support **3×** more concurrent comparisons.  
- **Research-aware engineer:** eval tooling, algorithm selection, audio ML, and interpretability.  

## Experience
**Amazon — Alexa AI (NLU), SDE Intern**  
- Built ML support tools and a central analysis platform used by 20+ scientists.  
- Increased analysis throughput (**3×** concurrent comparisons) via caching/parallelization.  
- Co-designed evaluation metrics/frameworks for LLM API-calling behavior at scale.

## Selected Projects
| Project | What it is | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Analysis Platform for ML Scientists** | Lightweight services for experiment tracking, cached comparisons, batched data access | Enabled **3×** concurrent comparisons |
| **Energy-Aware Algorithm Selection** | Perf/energy traces for solvers; features for low-energy picks | Lower energy at similar quality |
| **Dolphin Acoustics** | Signal processing + ML/CV pipeline | F1 **0.48 → 0.86** |
