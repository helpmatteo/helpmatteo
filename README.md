## Summary
- **SWE/ML focus** with shipped tooling and analysis platforms used by 20+ scientists
- **Throughput & reliability:** scaled comparisons (**3×** concurrent) via caching/parallelism; reproducible pipelines
- **Research-aware engineer:** shipped eval tooling; projects across algorithm selection, audio ML, and interpretability
- **BSc (Hons) CS & Mathematics, First Class** — University of St Andrews

## Experience
**Amazon — Alexa AI (NLU), SDE Intern**  
- Built ML support tools + a central analysis platform used by 20+ scientists  
- Increased analysis throughput (**3×** concurrent comparisons) with caching/parallelization  
- Co-designed evaluation metrics/frameworks for LLM API-calling behavior at scale

## Selected Projects (SWE & ML)
**Analysis Platform for ML Scientists** — lightweight services for experiment tracking, cached comparisons, and batched data access.  
**Energy-Aware Algorithm Selection** — long-horizon perf/energy traces; features for ML models to pick lower-energy solvers.  
**Dolphin Acoustics (Detection & Classification)** — signal-processing + ML/CV; F1 **0.48 → 0.86** vs prior approach.
