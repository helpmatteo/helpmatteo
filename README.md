# Matteo He — Software Engineer & LLM Research (Interpretability)

I’m a software engineer with a strong ML/LLM focus, especially on **automated interpretability** and **evaluation tooling**. I care about clear, reproducible results and practical systems that improve researcher productivity.

- 🎓 **BSc (Hons) Computer Science & Mathematics, First Class**, University of St Andrews  
- 💬 **Alexa AI (NLU) — SDE Intern**: built NLP/ML tooling that improved analysis efficiency and data access for scientists  
- 🧠 **Project**: Automating explanations of GPT-2 attention heads; measurable gains on multiple similarity metrics  
- 🔌 **Research**: Energy-aware algorithm selection (dataset + analysis); dolphin acoustics classifier with large F1 lift  
- 🏆 Hackathon wins (Oxbotica @ OxfordHack), GRE **340/340**

## Selected Projects
**Automating Interpretability of Attention Heads (GPT-2)**  
New method to generate explanations for attention heads; compared token-sequence splitting strategies, reducing wrong tokens and improving Jensen–Shannon distance, Bhattacharyya coefficient, and cosine distance on specific layers. *Code & write-up coming here when public.*

**Energy-Aware Algorithm Selection**  
Collected long-horizon performance/energy traces for constraint solvers; built datasets and analyses to identify features for ML models that pick lower-energy algorithms.

**Dolphin Acoustics — Detection & Classification**  
Signal processing + ML/CV pipeline that improved F1 from **0.48 → 0.86** vs a previous approach; refactored the group codebase to streamline setup and debugging.
